# Predicting drug predilections from personality

The University of California at Irvine has a [repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) of various datasets for machine learning applications, [one of which](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29#) is concerned with the consumption of drugs from 1885 respondents. 

Data about 12 attributes are gathered from each respondent, ranging from personality type to country of residence and ethnicity. Then questions about eighteen legal and illegal drugs and when the respondent last used them are asked.

The data is already quantified.

## Proposal

Can we answer which drug(s) a participant is most likely to use, based solely on their personality?

Or can we infer personality based on drug use?
